# **Stock-Analysis-**
Creating a stock analysis to help my friend Kevin
## **Overview of Project**
The purpose of this project was to create a stock analysis file for our friend Kevin. After compiling the original project we received a separate file that needed the VBA code to be refactored in order to collect stock information from 2017 and 2018 to help advise Kevin on what stocks to invest in and not to. The original code we created worked but was not as efficient as the refactored code we worked through.
## **Results**

###### **Performance Analysis**
Overall the selection of stocks that Kevin's parents are interested in investing in had strong returns in 2017 but only 2 of the companies saw YoY growth in their returns in 2018. The best performing stock was >ENPH who had positive returns in both 2017 and 2018 and a 78.4% YoY growth in returns from 2017 to 2018.

###### ** Execution Time**
The execution time on the refactored script was faster and more efficient than our original VBA script. As you can see below our 2017 and 2018 scripts ran in under half a second.

##**Summary**

######Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code:

**Pros**
The advantages of refactoring the code is that it helped the code become more organized by being easier to read and understand what each section of codes purpose was when running. By becoming more organized it also helps run time decrease and makes it easier to debug for the user. All of the benefits for the creater follow suit for any other users of the file; if Kevin wanted to see what we wrote out for his code it woud be a lot easier for him to understand each step of the code we wrote for him.

**Cons**
The only real disadvantage to refactoring the code was that it was time consuming, in this case the refactoring we did saved us a couple seconds from the original code in terms of run time.

######Pros and Cons of Refactoring _this vba script_

**Pros**
By refactoring the script I was able to debug my mistakes faster. Another pro is that we decreased the run time of the script making a more efficent product for Kevin. Another advantage of refactoring the code is that Kevin will be able to better underestand it when he gets the file. On a personal level refactoring the code was very benefical in helping me learn VBA code and understanding what I was doing.

**Cons**
As mentioned in the above cons the only real disadvantage was refactoring the code was very time consuming.
